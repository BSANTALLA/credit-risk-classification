# credit-risk-classification

An overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis is to assess a Machine Learning Model through logistic regression. Focusing on loan size, interest rate, income, debt to income ration, accounts, derogatory marks, and total debts - the model can predict the loan status as either a "healthy loan" or "high-risk loan."

Machine Learning Info
- split data into training/testing data sets
- create and fit a logistic regression model
- evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall

Results
Accuracy: The accuracy of the model is 0.99
Precision: Precision for healthy loans is (0) is 1.00. Precision for high-risk loans is 0.87. The model is more effective with healthy loans than high-risk loans.
Recall: The recall is more in line with healthy than high-risk loans.

Summary:
I would recommend the model to be used as it is completely accurate for healthy loans. Which would be the most important to clear right away since it would be easy loans to start processing. However, to be a bit concered with high-risk loans, perhaps adding an extra eye to low/mid risk loans to ensure it's accurately prediciting the risk. Of course the model can alway be improved and more accurately depict both high risk and healthy loans, however, no major lifts required.
